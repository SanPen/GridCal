            WINDV2 and WINDV3 are specified (the units of RMAn and RMIn are also
            governed by CW when |CODn| is 1 or 2):
            1 for off-nominal turns ratio in pu of winding bus base voltage
            2 for winding voltage in kV

            NOMV1, NOMV2 and NOMV3.

        CZ  The impedance data I/O code defines the units in which the winding impedances
            R1-2, X1-2, R2-3, X2-3, R3-1 and X3-1 are specified:

            1 for resistance and reactance in pu on system MVA base and  winding voltage base

            2 for resistance and reactance in pu on a specified MVA base and winding voltage base

            3 for transformer load loss in watts and impedance magnitude in pu on a specified
              MVA base and winding voltage base.

            In specifying transformer leakage impedances, the base voltage values are always
            the nominal winding voltages that are specified on the third, fourth and fifth records
            of the transformer data block (NOMV1, NOMV2 and NOMV3). If the default NOMVn
            is not specified, it is assumed to be identical to the winding n bus base voltage.
            CZ = 1 by default.
        CM The magnetizing admittance I/O code defines the units in which MAG1 and MAG2 are specified:

            bus voltage base

            two MVA base (SBASE1-2) and nominal Winding 1 voltage, NOMV1.
            CM = 1 by default.
        MAG1, MAG2: The transformer magnetizing admittance connected to ground at bus I.
            When CM is 1, MAG1 and MAG2 are the magnetizing conductance and suscep-
            tance, respectively, in pu on system MVA base and Winding 1 bus voltage base.
            When a non-zero MAG2 is specified, it should be entered as a negative quantity.
            When CM is 2, MAG1 is the no load loss in watts and MAG2 is the exciting current
            in pu on Winding 1 to two MVA base (SBASE1-2) and nominal Winding 1 voltage
            (NOMV1). For three-phase transformers or three-phase banks of single phase
            transformers, MAG1 should specify the three-phase no-load loss. When a non-zero
            MAG2 is specified, it should be entered as a positive quantity.
            MAG1 = 0.0 and MAG2 = 0.0 by default.
        NMETR The non-metered end code of either 1 (for the Winding 1 bus) or 2 (for the Winding 2 bus).
            In addition, for a three-winding transformer, 3 (for the Winding 3 bus) is a valid
            specification of NMETR. NMETR = 2 by default.

            characters and may contain any combination of blanks, uppercase letters, numbers
            and special characters. NAME must be enclosed in single or double quotes if it
            contains any blanks or special characters. NAME is twelve blanks by default.
        STAT Transformer status of one for in-service and zero for out-of-service.
            In addition, for a three-winding transformer, the following values of STAT provide for
            one winding out-of-service with the remaining windings in-service:
            2 -> for only Winding 2 out-of-service
            3 -> for only Winding 3 out-of-service
            4 -> for only Winding 1 out-of-service
            STAT = 1 by default.
        Oi: An owner number (1 through 9999). Each transformer may have up to four owners.
            By default, O1 is the owner to which bus I is assigned and O2, O3, and O4 are zero.
        Fi: The fraction of total ownership assigned to owner Oi; each Fi must be positive. The
            Fi values are normalized such that they sum to 1.0 before they are placed in the
            working case. By default, each Fi is 1.0.
        VECGRP: Alphanumeric identifier specifying vector group based on transformer winding
            connections and phase angles. VECGRP value is used for information purpose
            only. VECGRP is 12 blanks by default

        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        The first three data items on the second record are read for both two- and three-winding trans-
        formers; the remaining data items are used only for three-winding transformers:

        R1-2, X1-2 The measured impedance of the transformer between the buses to which its first
            and second windings are connected.
            When CZ is 1, they are the resistance and reactance, respectively, in pu on system
            MVA base and winding voltage base.
            When CZ is 2, they are the resistance and reactance, respectively, in pu on Winding
            1 to 2 MVA base (SBASE1-2) and winding voltage base.
            When CZ is 3, R1-2 is the load loss in watts, and X1-2 is the impedance magnitude

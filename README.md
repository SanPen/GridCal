# Installation

You can choose to install GridCal through pip or just get a standalone setup ready to run.

- From your python distribution on any OS: `pip install GridCal`

- [GridCal standalone for windows x64](https://www.advancedgridinsights.com/gridcal)


For more options and details follow the
[installation instructions](https://gridcal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/install.html).


### Execution

If you have just installed GridCal on your python distribution, 
you can call the GUI with the following command:

`python3 -c "from GridCal.ExecuteGridCal import run; run()"`

### Testing GridCal

    python3 -m venv venv
    venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements_venv.txt
    venv/bin/python -m tox

 For detailed instructions, follow the
[instructions](https://gridcal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html)
from the project's documentation.

# Batteries included

In an effort to ease the simulation and construction of grids, 
We have included extra materials to work with. These are included in the standalone setups.

[Here](https://github.com/SanPen/GridCal/tree/master/Grids_and_profiles) you can find:
- Load profiles for your projects
- Standard IEEE grids as well as grids from open projects
- [Equipment catalogue](https://gridcal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_sheets.html) (Wires, Cables and Transformers) ready to use in GridCal

### Examples

Examples are included in [Tutorials](https://gridcal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tutorials_module.html) section. In addition, the
tests under [src/tests](https://github.com/SanPen/GridCal/tree/master/src/tests) may serve as valuable examples.



# Features overview

It is in pure Python and it works for Windows, Linux and OSX.

Some features you'll find already are:

- Compatible with other formats:
  - **Import** (Drag & Drop)
    - CIM (Common Information Model v16)
    - PSS/e RAW versions 29, 30, 32, 33 and 34.
    - Matpower (might not be fully compatible, notify me if not).
    - DigSilent .DGS (not be fully compatible: Only positive sequence and devices like loads, generators, etc.)
    
  - **Export**
    - Zip file `.gridcal` with CSV inside (fastest, normal GridCal format) 
    - Sqlite
    - Excel
    - Custom JSON
    - CIM (Common Information Model v16)

- **Power flow**:
  - State of the art multi-terminal AC/DC Newton Raphson in power and current equations.
  - Newton Raphson Iwamoto (optimal acceleration).
  - Fast Decoupled Power Flow
  - AC/DC multi-terminal Levenberg-Marquardt (Works very well with large ill-conditioned grids)
  - Holomorphic Embedding Power Flow (Unicorn under investigation...)
  - DC approximation.
  - Linear AC approximation.
  
- **Optimal power flow (OPF)** and generation dispatch:
  - Linear (DC) with losses.
  - Linear (Ac) with losses.
  - Loss-less simple generation dispatch.  
  - All the modes can be split the runs in hours, days, weeks or months!

- **Time series** with profiles in all the objects physical magnitudes.

- **PTDF** approximated branch flow time series for super fast estimation of the flows.

- Bifurcation point with predictor-corrector Newton-Raphson.

- **Monte Carlo / Latin Hypercube** stochastic power flow based on the input profiles.

- **Blackout cascading** in simulation and step by step mode.

- Three-phase and unbalanced **short circuit**.

- Includes the Z-I-P load model, this means that the power flows can handle both power and current.

- The ability to handle island grids in all the simulation modes.

- **Profile editor** and importer from Excel and CSV.

- **Grid elements' analysis** to discover data problems.

- **Overhead line construction** from wire scheme.

- Device **templates** (lines and transformers).

- **Grid reduction** based on branch type and filtering by impedance values

- **Export** the schematic in SVG and PNG formats.

## Method 1 - Duplication of methods and CgmesCircuit class.
Main advantages are:

- Fast initial creation: copy-pasting files into versioned directories and replacing version numbers.
- Code for different versions is separated, making it easy to read, debug and apply version based modifications.
- Simplified code: no branching in the code.
- Faster execution: no need for property checks.

Disadvantage:
- Most of the code will be duplicated (multiplied).
- If you have to modify same logic for all versions 


## Method 2 - Usage of Protocol
Advantage:
- Don't need to import all versions or duplicate code
- Probably no need for branching in the code.
- Probably no need for property checks.

Disadvantage:
- You need to create classes implementing "Protocol" (with shared class members used in methods).

```python
from typing import Protocol, runtime_checkable
from typing import Dict, List
from VeraGridEngine.data_logger import DataLogger


@runtime_checkable
class ConductingEquipment(Protocol):
    uuid: str


class Terminal(Protocol):
    ConductingEquipment: ConductingEquipment
    rdfid: str
    tpe: str


class CgmesCircuit(Protocol):
    Terminal_list: List[Terminal]


class CgmesCircuit_3_0(CgmesCircuit):
    NewField: List[Terminal]


class Builder(Protocol):
    def create_connectivity_node(self) -> ConnectivityNode:
        pass


def get_gcdev_device_to_terminal_dict(cgmes_model: CgmesCircuit,
                                      builder: Builder,
                                      logger: DataLogger) -> Dict[str, List[Terminal]]:
    """
    Dictionary relating the conducting equipment to the terminal object(s)
    """
    # dictionary relating the conducting equipment to the terminal object
    device_to_terminal_dict: Dict[str, List[Terminal]] = dict()

    a = cgmes_model.NewField

    if isinstance(cgmes_model, CgmesCircuit_3_0):
        b = cgmes_model.NewField

    for e in cgmes_model.Terminal_list:
        if isinstance(e.ConductingEquipment, ConductingEquipment):
            lst = device_to_terminal_dict.get(e.ConductingEquipment.uuid, None)
            if lst is None:
                device_to_terminal_dict[e.ConductingEquipment.uuid] = [e]
            else:
                lst.append(e)
        else:
            logger.add_error(msg='The object is not a ConductingEquipment',
                             device=e.rdfid,
                             device_class=e.tpe,
                             device_property="ConductingEquipment",
                             value=e.ConductingEquipment,
                             expected_value='object')
    return device_to_terminal_dict


```


## Method 3 - Extension of methods, usage of type union
Main advantages are:
- The different versions of the logics will be managed in one place. (you can change the same logic to apply it for each version)
- No unnecessary code duplication.

Disadvantage:
- No real IDE assistance (IntelliSense for only one version).
- Harder to read and debug.

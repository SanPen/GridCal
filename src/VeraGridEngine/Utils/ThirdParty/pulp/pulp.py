PuLP is an linear and mixed integer programming modeler written in Python.

With PuLP, it is simple to create MILP optimisation problems and solve them with the
latest open-source (or proprietary) solvers.  PuLP can generate MPS or LP files and
call solvers such as GLPK_, COIN-OR CLP/`CBC`_, CPLEX_, GUROBI_, MOSEK_, XPRESS_,
CHOCO_, MIPCL_, HiGHS_, SCIP_/FSCIP_.

The documentation for PuLP can be `found here <https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/>`_.

Many examples are shown in the `documentation <https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/CaseStudies/index.html>`_
and pure code examples are available in `examples/ directory <https://github.com/coin-or/pulp/tree/master/examples>`_ .
The examples require at least a solver in your PATH or a shared library file.

Quickstart
------------
Use ``LpVariable`` to create new variables. To create a variable x with 0  ≤  x  ≤  3::

     from pulp import *
     x = LpVariable("x", 0, 3)

To create a binary variable, y, with values either 0 or 1::

     y = LpVariable("y", cat="Binary")

Use ``LpProblem`` to create new problems. Create a problem called "myProblem" like so::

     prob = LpProblem("myProblem", LpMinimize)

Combine variables in order to create expressions and constraints, and then add them to
the problem.::

     prob += x + y <= 2

An expression is a constraint without a right-hand side (RHS) sense (one of ``=``,
``<=`` or ``>=``). If you add an expression to a problem, it will become the
objective::

     prob += -4*x + y

To solve the problem  with the default included solver::

     status = prob.solve()

If you want to try another solver to solve the problem::

     status = prob.solve(GLPK(msg = 0))

Display the status of the solution::

     LpStatus[status]
     > 'Optimal'

You can get the value of the variables using ``value``. ex::

     value(x)
     > 2.0

Useful Classes and Functions
-----------------------------

Exported classes:

* ``LpProblem`` -- Container class for a Linear or Integer programming problem
* ``LpVariable`` -- Variables that are added into constraints in the LP problem
* ``LpConstraint`` -- Constraints of the general form

      a1x1 + a2x2 + ... + anxn (<=, =, >=) b

* ``LpConstraintVar`` -- A special type of constraint for constructing column of the model in column-wise modelling

Exported functions:

* ``value()`` -- Finds the value of a variable or expression
* ``lpSum()`` -- Given a list of the form [a1*x1, a2*x2, ..., an*xn] will construct a linear expression to be used as a constraint or variable
* ``lpDot()`` -- Given two lists of the form [a1, a2, ..., an] and [x1, x2, ..., xn] will construct a linear expression to be used as a constraint or variable

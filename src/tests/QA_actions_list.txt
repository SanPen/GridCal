        - Draw line (it will be automatically converted to a transformer)
        - Define name (legible)
        - Mention if you want to add PSSE code (it does not affect)
        - Define the parameters
        - Create the profiles
        - Add to contingencies
        - Add to investments


Video 4: Create In-and-out in a line

    - 1 Select the line where I want to create the In-and-out in a line
    - 2 Right bottom - SPlit line with in/out
        - Define % of the length where I want to split the line
        - Define the kilometers of the in and out lines
    - 3 Add contingencies

    Notes: The new power lines parameters will be the same as the original power line

Video 5: Add something (injection) to a bus (load or a generator..)

    - 1 Select the bus I want to install the load or generator
    - 2 Right button - Load / Generator....
    - 3 Set the value of the P or Q
    - 4 Go to the DB and select the load/generator... Click the "Assign the selected property to the matching profile". Accept the message
    - 5 If I want to set a predefined profile, check add profiles to an object property

Video 6: Transform a line into other series element (reactance, transformer, HVDC ...)

    - 1 Select the line I want to install the load or generator
    - 2 Right button - Reactance / Transformer....
    - 3 Set the value parameters X
    - 4 Go to the DB and select the reactance/transformer..... Click the "Assign the selected property to the matching profile". Accept the message
    - 5 If I want to set a predefined profile, check add profiles to an object property

    Note: If it is an HVDC and I want to set the P. It should be in Control Mode = Pdc , and in Pset = the setpoint (a profile might be added)

Video 7: Add a profile to an object property
    - Using copy paste:
        - 1. Database / Time series
        - 2. Select where I want to paste it, and press paste button
    - Importing profiles:
        - 1. Database / Time series / Import profiles
        - 2 Import profile. Select sheet. ok . The prfile should have the samde length as the original VeraGrid time series
        - 3 Find the element I want to assign the profile and select it. Double click on the Profile box
        - 4 Important! Unmark both, set unasigned to zero, and normalize.
        - 5 Accept

*Video 8: Scale load / generation per area
    - 1 Menu - Model - Scale
    - 2 Select the Zone/ Region/Munipality I want to scale up/down
    - 3 Select the factor
    - 4 Choose if I want to do it in the snapshot (default), or if I want to extend it to the profiles (mark the check)
    - 5 Do it

*Video 9: Clustering
    - 1. Explain what clustering is, and how it is done.
    - 2. Explain how it is performed. Settings number of clusters
    - 3. Explain results expansion

Video 10: Power flow
    - 1. Check settings
    - 2. Check if I want time series and or clustering / Snapshot
    - 3. Run
    - 4. Results

Video 11: Contingency analysis
    - 1. Check settings
    - 2. Check if I want time series and or clustering / Snapshot
    - 3. Run
    - 4. Results (same as in Redeval)
    - 5. Show SRAP results

*Video 12: Visualization
    - Zoom - scroll
    - Move - CTRL + drag
    - Part 1: Vecinity diagram
        - 1 In DB- Bus/Line/..., select a bus/line/...
        - 2 Click on add bus "Bus Vecinity viewer of the selected items"
        - 3 Go to diagrams
        - 4 Click on center view
        - 5 CLick (+) button to expand it

    - Part 2: Dense areas
        - 1 Select the part of the network I want to include in the new diagram
        - 2 Diagram/Bus-Branch OPtions/New diagram from selection
        - 3 Go to diagrams
        - 4 Click on center view
        - 5 CLick (+) button to expand it

*Video 13: Filters
    - In DB objects, filter bus by name: "idxobj.name like arenas" where name is the header. If the headers has units avoid them "idxobj.Vnom = 132.0"
    - Note1:The filters in Objects are also applied to Time series
    - Note2:For results, normally it is better to download the file

*Video 14: Snaphsot-Time series
 - How to run time - series
 - How to run clustered (time series)- cluster needed before
 - How to take and hour

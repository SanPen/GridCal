        Run one timestep of the environment's dynamics.

        When end of episode is reached, you are responsible for calling :meth:`reset` to reset this environment's state.
        Accepts an action and returns either a tuple `(observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info)`.

        Args:
            action (ActType): an action provided by the agent

        Returns:
            observation (object): this will be an element of the environment's :attr:`observation_space`.
                This may, for instance, be a numpy array containing the positions and velocities of certain objects.
            reward (float): The amount of reward returned as a result of taking the action.
            terminated (bool): whether a `terminal state` (as defined under the MDP of the task) is reached.
                In this case further step() calls could return undefined results.
            truncated (bool): whether a truncation condition outside the scope of the MDP is satisfied.
                Typically a timelimit, but could also be used to indicate agent physically going out of bounds.
                Can be used to end the episode prematurely before a `terminal state` is reached.
            info (dictionary): `info` contains auxiliary diagnostic information
                (helpful for debugging, learning, and logging).
                This might, for instance, contain: metrics that describe the agent's performance state, variables
                that are hidden from observations, or individual reward terms that are combined to produce the
                total reward. It also can contain information that distinguishes truncation and termination, however
                this is deprecated in favour of returning two booleans, and will be removed in a future version.

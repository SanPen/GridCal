make.bat: "Traditional" way of calling the system declared sphinx-build command under windows.

make.sh: "Traditional" way of calling the system declared sphinx-build command under linux and macos.

make.py: Compile the documentation using the python distribution you use for development.

Any python that executes "sphinx-build" must have installed the same dependencies that GridCal has.

In short, if you want to compile the documentation locally, better use make.py, the others are there for read-the-docs.


Use:

`sphinx-apidoc -o ./rst_source/api/auto ../src/GridCal --tocfile modules`
`sphinx-apidoc -o ./rst_source/api/auto ../src/GridCalEngine --tocfile modules`

to build the api rst files

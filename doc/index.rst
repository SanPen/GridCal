GridCal started in 2015 with a clear objective: create a solid
programming library and a user-friendly interface. This straightforward
approach sparked many innovations — some driven by the necessity for
commercial use, and others fueled by curiosity and research.

Whether you’re a pro needing free tools, a researcher wanting a
real-world tested platform, a teacher sharing commercial-grade software
insights, or a student diving into practical algorithms, GridCal’s got
your back. It’s a high quality product made for all of us now and for
the future generations.

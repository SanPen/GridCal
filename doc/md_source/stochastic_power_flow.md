Precision
    Monte carlo standard deviation to achieve.
    The number represents the exponent of the precision.
    i.e. 3 corresponds to 1e-3

Max. Iterations
    Maximum iterations for Monte Carlo sampling
    if the simulation does not achieve the selected standard deviation.

Samples
    Number of samples for the latin hypercube sampling.

Additional islands until stop
    When simulating the blackout cascading, this is the number of islands
    that determine the stop of a simulation

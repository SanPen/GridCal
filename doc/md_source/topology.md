# 🌵 Topology

The topology processing in VeraGrid is handled automatically, and you need to do nothing for it to work.

Branches with the `reducible` flag enabled are candidates for disappearing at the 
`NumericalCircuit level when computing any simulation. Typically, switches will be reduced, but if not they will
use their declared impedance, which is not advised.

## Other topology functions

There are some other topological functions that can be accessed through the GUI for special purposes.

Select branch types to reduce
    The topological reduction is a top feature of VeraGrid. With it you can remove the influence of the redundant
    branches. This is specially relevant when you are provided with grids that have thousands of switches and
    connection branches that add no simulation value. Those can be removed in a very smart way.

Filter by r+x under threshold
    This feature establishes if to topologically remove branches whose resistance + reactance
    is lower than a threshold. The threshold is given by the exponent number. i.e. 5 corresponds to `r+x < 1e-5`.

Automatic layout algorithm
    Another nice feature in VeraGrid is the ability to sort bus bar locations according to a graph algorithm.
    This is especially useful when you are provided with a grid that has no schematic, where the graphical
    representation depict all the bus bars in the same place.

Ask before applying
    Raise a question before applying the graph layout algorithm.

Node expansion factor
    The nodes in VeraGrid can be expanded (far from each other) or shrink (closer) this parameter
    set the "explosion" factor that determines how far from each other shall the nodes become.

Branch rating factor
    For the branch automatic rating, this is the rate multiplier.

Override values
    If selected any non-zero rate is overridden by the calculated value.



## Theory
In this section, we are going to explain how to do topology processing properly
for once and for all. This topic is of capital importance in power systems but is
rarely dealt with in a structured and comprehensive manner.

**A Graph in Power Systems**

A power system model is essentially a graph. A graph is structure
where relationships are represented with nodes (what is related) and edges (the relationship).
To understand topology processing, it's essential to grasp the basics of graph
theory. A graph is composed of:

- **Nodes (Buses):** Represent points of calculation, such as substations, generation points, or load centers.
- **Edges (Branches):** Represent the connections, such as transmission lines, transformers, or circuit breakers.

This abstraction simplifies the network, retaining its essential
connectivity and operational properties.

If you come from the Ontologies world, a power system's graph is strictly speaking buses and branches.
Branches connected to fictitious entities that may or may not be connected to buses have no room here.

**Why is Topology Processing Important?**

Topology processing ensures that the network's operational model accurately
reflects its physical state. Without proper processing, analyses may yield
inaccurate results, leading to operational inefficiencies or even failures.

Key reasons include:

- Ensuring the model is computationally feasible.
- Identifying and correcting data inconsistencies.
- Optimizing the simulation by reducing unnecessary complexities.

In less abstract terms, topology processing is about determining the simulatable
sub-circuits within a circuit. Here, a circuit refers to a collection of equipment,
its relationships, and states in the most general sense. We perform the topology
processing as a precaution before simulating, because what we want is to be able to
use the electrotechnical formulas to get the physical magnitudes, and for that we must
abide to some rules. Thus, from circuit theory, we derive the following fundamental
relationship:

$$ Y \times V = I^* $$

Where:

- $Y$ is the nodal admittance matrix.
- $V$ is the vector of bus voltages.
- $I$ is the vector of current injections at the buses.

To solve for $V$, we need to invert $Y$:

$$V = Y^{-1} \times I^*$$

However, $Y$ may not always be invertible for any arbitrary collection
of equipment. This necessitates finding sub-circuits. Additionally, certain
branches in the circuit might have zero impedance, making $Y$ singular. We
must eliminate these problematic branches as part of the processing.

### Steps in Topology Processing

Broadly, topology processing involves the following steps:

1. **Reduce problematic branches:** Address switches and jumpers that cause singularities.
2. **Find the simulatable islands:** Identify isolated groups of interconnected elements.
3. **Segment the circuit into sub-circuits:** Divide the system into smaller, manageable parts.
4. **Simulate each circuit independently:** Perform separate analyses for each sub-circuit.*
5. **Reassemble the results:** Combine outcomes to match the original circuit structure.


> Steps 2 to 5 are necessary only for simulations reliant on equality constraints,
  such as power flow. Simulations involving overdetermined linear systems, such as
  optimizations, do not require separate handling of islands.


Performing topology processing requires one critical function: the island search.
This function identifies interconnected segments of the network, ensuring accurate
representation of the system's operational state.


### 1 Reducing problematic branches

In the context of power systems, certain branches can cause computational issues due
to their characteristics, such as zero impedance or inactive status. These branches,
referred to as *problematic branches*, must be effectively reduced to ensure accurate
simulations and analyses. To better understand this, let’s examine the following
example circuit:

| Bus from | Bus to | Reducible | impedance | active |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 0        | 1      | yes       | 0         | yes    |
| 0        | 2      | no        | 0.05j     | yes    |
| 1        | 3      | no        | 0.01j     | yes    |
| 2        |  3     | yes       | 0         | no     |


> It is important to understand the meaning of zero when talking about physical magnitudes
  such as the impedance. Zero is the *absence of*, therefore zero impedance means that
  the branch is not there. Hence, we must remove it and join the buses it connects.

This circuit consists of 4 buses and 4 branches. Two of these branches are marked
as "reducible," meaning their removal is needed to not impact the network's functional
properties for simulation purposes. These zero-impedance branches do not contribute to
the network’s overall impedance matrix, but would make it singular if added.
To identify reducible branches, we construct an adjacency matrix representing
connections between buses. The adjacency matrix is computed using the following algorithm:

```python
    n = number of buses
    m = number of branches
    A = lil_matrix(n, n)
    for k=0 to m:
        f = bus from of the branch k
        t = bus to of the branch k
        if branch k is active and reducible:
            A(f, f) += 1
            A(f, t) += 1
            A(t, f) += 1
            A(t, t) += 1
        end-if
    end-for
```

A method that is found to be approximately 2.5 times faster in practice is the following:

```python
    n = number of buses
    m = number of branches
    C = lil_matrix(m, n)
    for k=0 to m:
        f = bus from of the branch k
        t = bus to of the branch k
        if branch k is active and reducible:
            C(k, f) = 1
            C(k, t) = 1
        end-if
    end-for
    A = C.transpose x C
```

> Both methods require matrices `C` and `A` to be sparse. Dense matrices would
  demand excessive memory and computational resources, making them impractical
  for power system applications.


The nifty trick of composing A with the reducible elements, allows us to use a
standard island-finding algorithm to identify groups of buses connected by
reducible elements that can be treated as a single bus because they are
*topologically* the same place.

In the given example, buses 0 and 1 are grouped, meaning bus 1 is effectively
merged into bus 0. Buses 2 and 3 remain as independent nodes.

After processing the reducible branches, the simplified circuit is:

| Bus from | Bus to | impedance |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 0        | 2      | 0.05j     |
| 0        | 3      | 0.01j     |


### 2 Finding the simulatable islands

Now that we have a system without problematic branches, we need to proceed with
the island slicing. For that, we need to compute the Adjacency matrix using the
non-reducible, active branches. This is, the branches that have impedances and
can transmit electricity:

```python
    n = number of buses
    m = number of branches
    C = lil_matrix(m, n)
    for k=0 to m:
        f = bus from of the branch k
        t = bus to of the branch k
        if (branch k is active) and (bus f is active) and (bus t is active):
            C(k, f) = 1
            C(k, t) = 1
        end-if
    end-for

    A = C.transpose x C
```

1. **Initialization:** A sparse auxiliary matrix `C` is initialized to capture branch
   connections.
2. **Branch Iteration:** Each branch is checked for activity and the corresponding buses
   are verified to be active.
3. **Matrix Assembly:** Connections between the "from" and "to" buses are recorded in `C`.
4. **Adjacency Matrix Construction:** The final adjacency matrix `A` is obtained through
   a matrix multiplication operation on `C`.

With the adjacency matrix `A` constructed, standard island-detection algorithms can be
applied to identify groups of interconnected buses. These groups, referred to as
"simulatable islands," represent sub-networks that can independently support simulation.

```python
islands = find_islands(A)
```

The `islands` variable contains a list of vectors, where each vector represents the
indices of buses within a single island. For example, in a simple network, two
interconnected buses might form one island, while isolated buses form separate islands.

For each identified island, it is crucial to verify the presence of at least one voltage
source or slack node. Without a slack node, the island cannot be powered, resulting in a
blackout for that portion of the network. Slack nodes provide the necessary reference
voltage and power balance for the island’s operation.


#### Islands search function

The island search function is a depth-first search that exploits the CSC structure of
the adjacency matrix. The particular version of the DFS algorithm presented here avoids
recursivity in favor of cues for faster execution.

```bash
indptr: index pointers in the CSC scheme
indices: column indices in the CSCS scheme
active: array of bus active states
n = bus number

visited = zeros(n)

islands = list()

node_count = 0
current_island = zeros(n)

island_idx = 0

for node=0 to node_number:

    if not visited[node] and active[node]:

        stack = list()
        stack.add(node)

        while stack.size > 0:

            v = stack.first
            remove first element from the stack

            if not visited[v]:

                visited[v] = 1

                current_island[node_count] = v
                node_count += 1

                for i=indptr[v] to indptr[v + 1]:
                    k = indices[i]
                    if not visited[k] and active[k]:
                        stack.add(k)
                    end-if
                end-for
            end-if
        end-while

        # slice the current island to its actual size
        island = current_island[:node_count].copy()
        island.sort()  # sort in-place

        # assign the current island
        islands.append(island)

        # increase the islands index, because
        island_idx += 1

        # reset the current island
        # no need to re-allocate "current_island" since it is going to be overwritten
        node_count = 0
    end-if
end-for
```


### 3 Segment the circuit into islands

After removing problematic branches, the next crucial step is to segment the circuit
into islands. An island is defined as a group of interconnected buses that form an
independent sub-network. This segmentation is essential for accurately analyzing and
simulating the system. To achieve this, we slice the grid's data structures based on
the island information.

An island is represented as a vector of bus indices. For instance, if an island
contains buses 4, 5, 6, and 7, this vector would be `[4, 5, 6, 7]`. Using this
information, slicing a data structure containing only bus data is straightforward.
However, slicing structures such as branch or load data requires additional steps.

To efficiently handle slicing, we create a bus mapping array that maps the original
bus indices to the indices of the island. For example, consider a circuit with 8
buses, where the island comprises buses 4, 5, 6, and 7. The mapping process is as
follows:

1. Initialize an array of size 8 filled with `-1` to represent unmapped buses.
2. Assign new island indices to the corresponding positions in the array.

```python
island = (4, 5, 6, 7)
bus_map = -1 x ones(8)
ii = 0
for i in island:
    bus_map[i] = ii
    ii += 1
end-for

The bus map is:
bus_map = (-1, -1, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3)
```

Now, consider the following branch data for the grid:

| Name     | bus_from | bus_to |
|----------|----------|--------|
| 0:Branch | 2        | 0      |
| 1:Branch | 3        | 2      |
| 2:Branch | 1        | 0      |
| 3:Branch | 1        | 2      |
| 4:Branch | 6        | 4      |
| 5:Branch | 7        | 6      |
| 6:Branch | 5        | 4      |
| 7:Branch | 5        | 6      |

With a simple algorithm we can determine which branch indices belong to the island:

```python
    m = number of branches
    elements_indices = list()
    for k=0 to m:
        f = branch k from bus
        t = branch k to bus
        if bus_map[f] > -1 and bus_map[t] > -1:
            elements_indices.add(k)
```
in this case elements_indices are `(4, 5, 6, 7)` 
Hence, the sliced island branch data is:

| Name     | bus_from | bus_to |
|----------|----------|--------|
| 4:Branch | 6        | 4      |
| 5:Branch | 7        | 6      |
| 6:Branch | 5        | 4      |
| 7:Branch | 5        | 6      |

Using the bus_map, we need to re-map the "from" and "to" buses of the sliced structure:


| Name     | bus_from | bus_to |
|----------|----------|--------|
| 4:Branch | 2        | 0      |
| 5:Branch | 3        | 2      |
| 6:Branch | 1        | 0      |
| 7:Branch | 1        | 2      |

For data structures like loads, the slicing process is similar. However, these
structures typically involve a single bus index rather than "from" and "to" indices.
By consistently applying the bus mapping array, we can accurately extract relevant
data for any island.

Segmenting the circuit into islands eliminates inactive buses, branches, and devices
that might otherwise introduce errors into simulations. This step significantly
improves computational efficiency and ensures cleaner, more reliable data for
numerical calculations such as power flow analysis. The resulting islands form
distinct, manageable sub-networks ready for independent simulation and analysis.

### Summary of the steps

- First we must detect which buses are electrically (and topologically) the same as others.
- Then we find the electrical islands.

For both steps we use the islands search over an adjacency matrix (A).
In the first connectivity matrix (A), we reflect the connections of the branches that we want to reduce.
In the second connectivity matrix (A), we reflect the connection of the branches that we want to keep.

### The spirit of CIM

If you've encountered CIM or CGMES, or participated in guild discussions, you've
likely heard about **node-breaker** and **bus-branch** modeling styles as distinct
approaches. ENTSO-e's introductory CGMES training has historically taught that
you can model using either **ConnectivityNodes** or **TopologicalNodes** (AKA Buses).
This guidance has been shared with hundreds of engineers accustomed to simpler
models of buses, lines, etc., only to face what seems to be gratuitous complexity.

After deep examination, one finds that this complexity is indeed unjustified.
The **node-breaker** and **bus-branch** philosophies are fundamentally the same,
as demonstrated through the processes described in this document.

> - A ConnectivityNode is a **bus** before the topology processing.
> - A TopologyNode is a **bus** after the topology processing.

The modeling approaches are often thought of as follows:

- **Bus-branch modeling:** This style involves using **TopologicalNodes** and
  no switches.
- **Node-breaker modeling:** This style involves using **ConnectivityNodes**
  and switches.

Following this, the TopologyNode's should not be shared and switched 
must be always reduced before simulation in any case to avoid numerical singularities.

**Debunking Misconceptions**: A common misconception is that bus-branch models 
lack switches, whereas node-breaker models include them. In practice, both 
approaches can incorporate switches. This fact is often emphasized in official CGMES trainings. 
If a **ConnectivityNode** must have an N:1 association with a **TopologicalNode**, this
implies that any ConnectivityNode ultimately represents a TopologicalNode.
This reinforces the argument that both are two faces of the same coin,
**Making both styles fundamentally equal.**

**The Philosophy Behind CIM**

One would imagine that the intent behind CIM’s design philosophy is to model
grids using **ConnectivityNodes**, with **TopologicalNodes** emerging naturally
through topological reductions (e.g., simplifying branches).
This implies that we should not share TopologicalNodes, since those are
internal artifacts of a calculation software such as VeraGrid.

Over time, the practice of treating detailed models as node-breaker models
and processed, less-detailed models as bus-branch has created an
artificial divide that has proven impractical and needlessly complicated.

**Why the Complexity?**

One can understand that the lack of a properly clear topology processing method
has likely sparked this complexity, creating a middle ground that combines the
worst aspects of both approaches. Engineers attempting to reconcile the two
styles often encounter unnecessary confusion and inefficiency.

**Revisiting CIM’s Spirit**

If we examine the original spirit of CIM: **ConnectivityNodes are no different
from traditional Buses.** The distinction is a myth that adds unnecessary
complexity to modeling workflows. By adhering to this perspective, we can
simplify processes and focus on building more efficient and accurate models.


### How is it done in VeraGrid?

In VeraGrid, the **MultiCircuit** serves as the grid's in-memory database. It is
crucial that no topological processing is ever performed directly on the
MultiCircuit. Doing so risks altering the topology of elements, potentially
breaking the consistency of the original configuration.

**Why Avoid Topological Processing on the MultiCircuit?**

Consider the following example: Imagine a generator initially connected to
**Bus 1**. After performing topological processing, it might end up connected to
**Bus 2**. How could we recover the original connection to **Bus 1**? Simply put,
we cannot. Altering the MultiCircuit directly compromises its integrity,
making it impossible to restore the original topology. In CIM, this is probably why
there are two distinct sets of objects; ConnectivityNode to maintain the structure
and TopologicalNode to represent the final connectivity. This reinforces the idea
that we must only model with ConnectivityNodes, which for simplicity are always
buses in the end in VeraGrid.

**The Role of NumericalCircuit**

If topology processing should not occur over the database, then where should it
be done? The solution in VeraGrid is to provide the **NumericalCircuit**, a snapshot of
the MultiCircuit at a specific state. This snapshot is **fungible**, meaning any
modifications made to it will not impact the original MultiCircuit and will
vanish after the calculation. As such, all topology processing steps are
performed on the **NumericalCircuit**, as described earlier in this section.

**CIM Compatibility Adjustments**

To ensure compatibility with CIM standards, we have introduced a single
adjustment:

- Every **ConnectivityNode** must either create a bus or be associated with an
  existing bus.
- Similarly, every **BusBar** must either create a connectivity node or be
  associated with one.

This guarantees that no matter which object you use for modeling, the system
will ultimately rely on buses, maintaining consistency across all calculation
processes in every scenario and avoiding the superficial complexity of having two
sets of objects for the same thing; Representing a node in a graph.

By doing this, we also put an end to the node-breaker vs. bus-branch feud,
allowing for compatibility with the so-called legacy models.

### Takeaways


- Bus-branch and node-breaker modelling styles are the same thing.
- In VeraGrid, always model with buses, you'll thank me later.
- In CIM/CGMES, model always with ConnectivityNodes and forget
  about the TopologicalNodes, you'll thank me later.
- In topology processing, we use the find-islands algorithm, combined
  with different compositions of adjacency matrices (A), element traversing
  should only happen when composing the adjacency matrices.

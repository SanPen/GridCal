Power Flow
==========

The following subsections include theory about the power flow algorithms supported by
**GridCal**. For control modes (both :ref:`reactive power control<q_control>` and
:ref:`transformer OLTC control<taps_control>`), refer to the
:ref:`Power Flow Driver API Reference<pf_driver>`.

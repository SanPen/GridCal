Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

    connected              bool                       False          65536            The connected status is related to a bus-branch model and the topological node to terminal relation.  True implies the terminal is connected to the related topological node and false implies it is not.  In a bus-branch model, the connected status is used to tell if equipment is disconnected without having to change the connectivity described by the topological node to terminal relation. A valid case is that conducting equipment can be connected in one end and open in the other. In particular for an AC line segment, where the reactive line charging can be significant, this is a relevant case.

    connected            bool                       False          65536            The connected status is related to a bus-branch model and the topological node to terminal relation.  True implies the terminal is connected to the related topological node and false implies it is not.  In a bus-branch model, the connected status is used to tell if equipment is disconnected without having to change the connectivity described by the topological node to terminal relation. A valid case is that conducting equipment can be connected in one end and open in the other. In particular for an AC line segment, where the reactive line charging can be significant, this is a relevant case.

The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended.

    mRID                 str                        False          65536            Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

An example would be the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) code for a coordinate reference system, defined in URN under the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) namespace as: urn:ogc:def:uom:EPSG::XXXX, where XXXX is an EPSG code (a full list of codes can be found at the EPSG Registry web site http://www.epsg-registry.org/). To define the coordinate system as being WGS84 (latitude, longitude) using an EPSG OGC, this attribute would be urn:ogc:def:uom:EPSG::4236. A profile should limit this code to a set of allowed URNs agreed to by all sending and receiving parties.

The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

    connected            bool                       False          65536            The connected status is related to a bus-branch model and the topological node to terminal relation.  True implies the terminal is connected to the related topological node and false implies it is not.  In a bus-branch model, the connected status is used to tell if equipment is disconnected without having to change the connectivity described by the topological node to terminal relation. A valid case is that conducting equipment can be connected in one end and open in the other. In particular for an AC line segment, where the reactive line charging can be significant, this is a relevant case.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

    mRID                str                      False          65536            Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

    mRID                 str                        False          65536            Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

    mRID                 str                        False          65536            Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

    mRID                 str                        False          65536            Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

    connected              bool                         False          65536            The connected status is related to a bus-branch model and the topological node to terminal relation.  True implies the terminal is connected to the related topological node and false implies it is not.  In a bus-branch model, the connected status is used to tell if equipment is disconnected without having to change the connectivity described by the topological node to terminal relation. A valid case is that conducting equipment can be connected in one end and open in the other. In particular for an AC line segment, where the reactive line charging can be significant, this is a relevant case.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

    mRID                 str                        False          65536            Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

    mRID                str               False          65536            Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

    mRID                str               False          65536            Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

    oscillatory        bool                 False          65536            To prevent some overload of the communication it is sensible to detect and suppress oscillating (fast changing) binary inputs. If a signal changes in a defined time (tosc) twice in the same direction (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) then oscillation is detected and the detail quality identifier &quot;oscillatory&quot; is set. If it is detected a configured numbers of transient changes could be passed by. In this time the validity status &quot;questionable&quot; is set. If after this defined numbers of changes the signal is still in the oscillating state the value shall be set either to the opposite state of the previous stable value or to a defined default value. In this case the validity status &quot;questionable&quot; is reset and &quot;invalid&quot; is set as long as the signal is oscillating. If it is configured such that no transient changes should be passed by then the validity status &quot;invalid&quot; is set immediately in addition to the detail quality identifier &quot;oscillatory&quot; (used for status information only).

The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

True implies the terminal is connected to the related topological node and false implies it is not.  In a bus-branch model, the connected status is used to tell if equipment is disconnected without having to change the connectivity described by the topological node to terminal relation. A valid case is that conducting equipment can be connected in one end and open in the other. In particular for an AC line segment, where the reactive line charging can be significant, this is a relevant case.

For example to represent a tie to a shunt component (like a load or generator) in another area, this is the near end of a branch and this attribute would be specified as false.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

    mRID                str                     False          65536            Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The mRID is globally unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID,  as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID.  The use of UUID is strongly recommended. For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.

For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552 Edition 1, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements.
